                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;  text-justify:inter-word;">Faith is like having
                            strong trust and belief in something even if we can't see
                            it. It's a bit like when you close your eyes and trust that your mom or dad will catch you
                            when you jump into their arms. Faith means having confidence in something or someone, even
                            if it's not right in front of you.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;  text-justify:inter-word;">Now, when we talk about
                            faith in Allah, it means having that special trust and
                            belief in Allah, who is like our caring and loving friend. We can't see Allah, but we
                            believe with all our heart that Allah is always with us, watching over us, and taking care
                            of us. It's like having a close bond with a friend you can talk to anytime, and knowing that
                            Allah loves us and guides us in the right direction. So, having faith in Allah is like
                            having a heart full of love and trust, knowing that we are never alone.

                            Prophets of Allah are special people chosen by Allah to help guide and teach us about how to
                            live good and happy lives. Imagine them as really wise and kind superheroes.
                            They share important messages from Allah. These special people,
                            called prophets, have a direct connection with Allah, and they are like messengers who bring
                            us wonderful advice and stories to make our lives better.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;  text-justify:inter-word;">Each prophet has a unique
                            story and message, like Prophet Noah who helped
                            animals and people during a big flood, or Prophet Moses who spoke to Allah and received the
                            Ten Commandments. Prophets are like amazing friends sent by Allah to remind us to be kind,
                            honest, and caring to one another. So, when we talk about the Prophets of Allah, we're
                            talking about these incredible people who teach us how to be the best versions of ourselves
                            and make the world a better place.

                            Angels are like magical beings that Allah created to help take care of the world and watch
                            over us. They're like invisible friends who work for Allah and do really important tasks.
                            Picture them as gentle and loving beings with wings, ready to spread kindness and goodness
                            wherever they go. Angels are special because they never get tired, and they always follow
                            Allah's instructions to keep everything running smoothly.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;  text-justify:inter-word;">There are different types
                            of angels, and each one has a special job. Some angels write down all the good things we do,
                            like being nice to our friends or helping our family. Others protect us from harm and help
                            make sure we stay safe. Angels are like the guardians that Allah sends to look after us, and
                            even though we can't see them, we can feel their positive energy around us. So, when we talk
                            about angels, we're talking about these invisible helpers who bring goodness and love into
                            our lives.

                            Prayer is like having a heart-to-heart talk with Allah, our special friend who is always
                            there for us. It's not like talking to your mom or dad; it's a quiet conversation in your
                            heart and mind. When we pray, we take a little time to thank Allah for all the good things
                            in our lives and ask for help or guidance when we need it. It's a bit like sending a letter
                            to a friend who cares about us a lot, and we know that Allah listens to our prayers with a
                            loving heart.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;  text-justify:inter-word;">During prayer, we can ask
                            Allah for forgiveness if we've made a mistake or share our hopes and dreams. It's a time to
                            feel close to Allah and express our feelings, just like telling a best friend about our day.
                            Praying is a special way to connect with Allah, and even though we can't see Him, we know
                            that He's always listening and understands our thoughts and feelings. So, when we pray,
                            we're building a strong and loving relationship with Allah that fills our hearts with peace
                            and joy.

                            Fasting is like going on a special adventure with Allah, and it happens during a month
                            called Ramadan. It's not a regular kind of adventure with maps and backpacks, but it's a
                            journey we take with our hearts and minds. During Ramadan, we don't eat or drink from
                            sunrise to sunset, and it helps us feel what it's like for people who might not have as much
                            food as we do. It's a bit like a challenge where we learn to be patient, grateful, and kind
                            to others.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;  text-justify:inter-word;">Fasting is not just about
                            not eating; it's also about doing good things and being the best version of ourselves. We
                            try extra hard to be kind to our friends and family, help others, and think about how we can
                            make the world a better place. It's a special time when we get closer to Allah, and by the
                            end of Ramadan, we feel proud of the adventure we've been on. Fasting is like a superpower
                            that helps us become stronger, kinder, and more thankful for all the blessings in our lives.

                            people who might need a little extra support. Imagine you have a big bag of toys, and some
                            of your friends don't have as many toys as you do. Zakat is like choosing some toys from
                            your bag and giving them to your friends to make them happy. But instead of toys, it's about
                            giving a small part of the money or things we have to people who need it more.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;  text-justify:inter-word;">When we give Zakat, we're
                            not only helping others, but we're also making our hearts feel warm and happy. It's like
                            spreading kindness and love to those who may be going through tough times. Zakat is a way of
                            showing gratitude to Allah for all the good things in our lives and sharing those blessings
                            with those who are in need. So, it's like being a superhero of goodness, making the world a
                            better place one caring act at a time.

                            Hajj is like a super special journey that grown-ups who follow Islam make to a really
                            important place called Mecca. It's a bit like a big adventure, and people from all around
                            the world come together to be a part of it. Imagine it as a huge family reunion, where
                            everyone wears simple white clothes to show that we are all equal and united. Hajj happens
                            once a year, and it's a bit like a magical trip to a place where lots of exciting things in
                            Islam happened a long, long time ago.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;  text-justify:inter-word;">During Hajj, people do
                            special rituals and prayers, and it's like a big celebration of faith and unity. It's not
                            just about the journey; it's also about being kind and helping others. It's like a giant
                            party of goodness! Hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and it's a way for people to
                            feel closer to Allah and to remember the important lessons from the past. So, when we hear
                            about Hajj, we're talking about this amazing and unique journey that brings people together
                            in a big, warm hug of love and faith.

                            Islam is like a big, beautiful rainbow that guides people on how to live a happy and good
                            life. It's not just a set of rules; it's a way of life that helps us be the best versions of
                            ourselves. Imagine Islam as a friendly guidebook that teaches us how to be kind, respectful,
                            and caring to everyone around us. It's like having a special map that leads us to a world
                            filled with love, understanding, and friendship.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;  text-justify:inter-word;">In Islam, we learn to be
                            grateful for the amazing things in our lives and to share with others who may need a little
                            extra help. It's like being part of a big, global family where everyone is important and
                            deserves love and respect. Islam is not just for certain people; it's for everyone who wants
                            to make the world a better and brighter place. So, when we say Islam, we're talking about
                            this wonderful way of living that helps us spread joy, kindness, and happiness to everyone
                            we meet.

                            Sunnah is like following the cool and kind things that Prophet Muhammad did when he was

                            friend, family member, and person we can be. Sunnah shows us the way to spread love, share,
                            and be super nice to everyone around us. Imagine Prophet Muhammad as a superhero, and his
                            actions and words are like the super cool moves he did to make the world a better place.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4" style="text-align:justify;  text-justify:inter-word;">When we do things the

                            how Prophet Muhammad did, such as helping others, saying nice words, and being honest. It's
                            not just about following rules; it's about making our hearts shine with kindness and being
                            awesome friends to everyone. Sunnah is like a treasure map, and by following it, we discover
